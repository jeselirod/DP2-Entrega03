We can suspend or cancel our Services if you do not comply with our policies or conditions or if we consider that your behavior may be malicious.
<br> <br>

Your content in our Services <br>
Some of our Services allow you to upload, send, store or receive content. If you do so, you will remain the owner of the intellectual property rights you have over that content. In a few words, what belongs to you is yours.
<br> <br>

<br> <br>
ACME-HACKER-RANK grants you a worldwide personal license, free of royalties, non-transferable and non-exclusive to use the software that is provided to you as part of the Services. The sole purpose of this license is to allow you to use the Services offered by ACME-HACKER-RANK and benefit from them, as stipulated in these conditions. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or lend any part of our Services or the included software or you may apply reverse engineering techniques or attempt to extract the source code of such software, unless the law prohibits such restrictions or if you have ACME's consent -MADRUGA in writing.
<br> <br>
ACME-HACKER-RANK attaches great importance to open source software. Some of the software used by our Services is offered with an open source software license that we will make available to you. Some of the provisions set forth in the open source software license may expressly nullify some of these conditions.
<br> <br>
How to modify and cancel our Services <br>
ACME-HACKER-RANK changes and improves its Services constantly. Therefore, it is possible that we add or remove some functions or features, or suspend or cancel a Service completely.
<br> <br>
You can stop using the Services at any time, although we would regret it.
<br> <br>
We consider that you are the owner of your data and that it is important to preserve your access to them. If we interrupt a Service, in cases where it is reasonable, we will inform you in advance and allow you to extract the information from the Service.
<br> <br>
Our guarantees and disclaimers of responsibility <br>
ACME-HACKER-RANK offers its Services with a level of competence and reasonable diligence from the commercial point of view, and we hope you enjoy using them. However we can not offer guarantees in relation to some aspects of our Services.
<br> <br>
Responsibility for our Services <br>
In the cases permitted by law, neither ACME-HACKER-RANK nor its suppliers or distributors will be responsible for the loss of profits, income, data, financial losses or for indirect, special, derivative, exemplary or punitive damages.
<br> <br>
To the extent permitted by law, the entire liability of ACME-HACKER-RANK, as well as that of its suppliers and distributors, for any claim made under these conditions, included by any implied warranty, is limited to the amount you have paid to use the Services (or, if ACME-HACKER-RANK so decides, upon the resumption of the Services).
<br> <br>
In no case, neither ACME-HACKER-RANK nor its suppliers and distributors will be responsible for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.
<br> <br>
ACME-HACKER-RANK recognizes that you may have legal rights as a consumer in some countries. If you use the Services for personal purposes, none of the provisions set forth in these conditions or in any of the additional conditions will limit the legal rights of the consumer that can not be waived contractually.
<br> <br>
Use of our Services by companies <br>
If you use the Services on behalf of a company, the company accepts these conditions. ACME-HACKER-RANK and its affiliates, officers, agents and employees shall be exempted from liability for claims, claims or legal actions that may arise from the use of the Services or the infraction of these conditions or that are related to them, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, claims, lawsuits, procedural costs and attorneys' fees.
<br> <br>
About these conditions <br>
ACME-HACKER-RANK can modify these conditions or the additional conditions that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect legislative changes or in the Services. We recommend that you check the conditions periodically. ACME-HACKER-RANK will publish notices related to the modifications of these conditions on this page. Likewise, it will publish notices related to the modifications that are made in the additional conditions of the corresponding Service. The modifications will not be applied retroactively and will take effect no later than 14 days from the date of their publication. However, modifications that affect new functions of a Service or changes made due to legal issues will take effect immediately. If you do not accept the modified conditions of a Service, you must stop using the Service.
<br> <br>
In case of conflict between these conditions and the additional conditions, these conditions will prevail over the additional conditions.
<br> <br>

These conditions govern the relationship between ACME-HACKER-RANK and you, and do not generate any rights from which a third party may be a beneficiary.
<br> <br>
If you do not comply with these conditions and ACME-HACKER-RANK does not take any action in this regard immediately, it will not be understood that ACME-HACKER-RANK waives any rights that may be available (such as, for example, carrying out actions in the future).
<br> <br>
In the event that a certain condition is not mandatory, the rest of the conditions will not be affected.
